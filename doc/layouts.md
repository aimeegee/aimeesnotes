## File structure in theme/\<theme-name\>/layouts

### /layouts/defaults/

The files in /_defaults/ are HTML templates that define the default layout for different types of pages in a Hugo site.

- `baseof.html` defines the base template that is used as the foundation for all other templates in the site. It typically includes the `head` and `body` sections of the page, as well as any common elements that are shared across multiple pages.
- `home.html` defines the layout for the homepage of the site. It typically includes a list of recent posts or other content that is specific to the homepage.
- `list.html` defines the layout for pages that display a list of content, such as a list of blog posts or a list of products. It typically includes a loop that iterates over the content and displays it in a consistent format.
- `single.html` defines the layout for individual pages that display a single piece of content, such as a blog post or a product detail page. It typically includes the content itself, as well as any related content or metadata.

By using these default templates, you can define the basic structure and layout of your site without having to create custom templates for each individual page. This can help to save time and make it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel across your site

### /layouts/partials/

The files in /partials/ are HTML templates that are used to define reusable components of a website, such as the header, footer, and menu.

- `header.html` defines the header section of a webpage, which typically includes the site logo, navigation menu, and other site-specific information.
- `footer.html` defines the footer section of a webpage, which typically includes copyright information, contact details, and links to other pages on the site.
- `menu.html` defines a navigation menu that can be included in the header or footer of a webpage.
- `head.html` defines the head section of a webpage, which typically includes metadata such as the page title, description, and keywords.
- `terms.html` defines the terms and conditions page of a website, which typically includes legal information about the use of the site.

By using HTML templates for these components, you can define them once and reuse them across multiple pages on your site. This can help to keep your code organized and make it easier to maintain.
