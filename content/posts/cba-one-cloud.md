# Our AWS workspace
## Types of Subnets and their differencxe
https://docs.cloud.cba/aws/getting-started/network/security-groups-subnets/ 
* The ECIF Security Group allow ingress connectivity from the Internet

# Tips
## Ping the external engineers directly to nudge PR review
- Security - Hemanth Varanasi
- NPS - Inderjeet Singh (he can only approve once security has approved) 
- Onecloud (after all the approvals are done) - ping the engineer on [roster](https://confluence.prod.cba/display/GTS/Cloud+Capability+Center+Ticket+Management)

# Lesson Learnt:
* Once the PR is approved by cyber, you need to remove the "Needs Security Approval". Only then it falls into OneCloud approval queue.
